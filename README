#MKMPacking

##Intro
A script to generate a reasonably priced combination of sellers to buy cards
from on Magic Card Market. Put the MKM urls of the cards in a file called
cardURLS.txt, one per line, and then run with Python. The algorithm used is
similar to that found in http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/ioerger/ICAI04-linli1.pdf
